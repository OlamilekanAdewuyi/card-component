## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
- Media queries for responsiveness
- Google Fonts (Poppins)

### What I learned
From this project, I learned how to structure my HTML and style it with CSS to create a neat design. I also practiced using media queries to make the layout responsive across different devices. This helped me understand how important responsiveness is when building modern webpages.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  main {
    padding: 20px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  .header-txt1 {
    font-size: 1.5rem; /* smaller title */
    text-align: center;
  }
  .header-text h2 {
    font-size: 1.4rem;
  }
  .header-paragraph-txt{
    width: 90%;
    padding: 0 10px;
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    line-height: 1.4;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
  }
  section {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 20px;
    align-items: center;
  }
  .box1,
  .box2,
  .box3,
  .box4 {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 320px;
    padding: 20px;
  }
  .box1 img,
  .box2 img,
  .box3 img,
  .box4 img {
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
  }
  section p {
    font-size: 0.85rem;
    width: 100%;
  }
}

## Continued development
For continued development, I want to keep improving my responsiveness skills by practicing how layouts adapt across different screen sizes. I also plan to refine my use of media queries, experimenting with multiple breakpoints to make designs smoother and more consistent. Additionally, Iâ€™d like to focus more on accessibility and clean code practices, ensuring that my projects are both user friendly and maintainable.
